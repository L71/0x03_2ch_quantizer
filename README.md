0x03 2ch Quantizer
==================

This thing is a two channel CV quantizer for Eurorack, intended to make sure
some oscillators played by an analog sequencer are actually playing in tune :)

* two CV input channels, two outputs 0-4.096V, four octaves @ 1V/oct.
* transpose knob per channel, +/- 1 octave in semitone steps
* The green LEDs will be brighter when transpose is set to -12/0/+12 half notes
* Red LED lights up if any channel tries to go off limits

It seems to work. PCBs are on order. Panel upcoming. :)
